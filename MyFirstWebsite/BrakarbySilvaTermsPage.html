            Subject to your compliance with these Terms, you may purchase the Shop Products made available on the Website. When browsing our Website, in order to purchase one or more Shop Products, you must first choose from any available options, such as color, length, size, and/or quantity of the Shop Goods, and then add the item to your online shopping cart (the “Cart”). Once you have added all Shop Products that you wish to purchase to your Cart, by going to your Cart you have an opportunity to review your order, including a description of the Shop Products, the order subtotal, shipping, and taxes. Once you have confirmed or made any necessary modifications to your order, you then must enter in your billing and shipping details, as well as credit card payment information. You agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information in connection with any purchase of Shop Products. By clicking “Place Order”, you confirm your agreement to purchase the applicable Shop Products and agree that we may charge you for the total cost displayed to you at such time. You understand and agree we may change the price for Shop Products from time to time, in our sole discretion, and it is your responsibility to confirm the total price displayed to you before you click “Place Order”. Changes to applicable fees are effective upon posting the changes on the Website.

            Although Brakar has made every effort to display our Shop Products and their colors and appearance as accurately as possible, the displayed attributes of the Shop Products depend upon the monitor of the User, and Brakar cannot guarantee that the User’s monitor will accurately portray the actual attributes of the Shop Products. Shop Products displayed may be out of stock or discontinued, and prices are subject to change. Brakar is not responsible for typographical errors regarding price or any other matter.

            SUBJECT TO YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU MAY  MAKE INQUIRES TO US REGARDING A DESIRE TO PURCHASE A CUSTOM PRODUCT FROM US. CUSTOM PRODUCTS BEGIN AT $3,000, AND ANY REQUESTS THAT DO NOT MEET THIS AMOUNT WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED.

            You may request a Custom Product by submitting the information requested on our “Custom Inquiries” page of the Website. Such information must include, but may not be limited to, your name and email address, the requested type of jewelry, gold quality and color, and specifying other details such as the dimensions and whether you intend to include diamonds in the Custom Product. You may also submit any designs, sketches, or other types of files that further explain how you desire the Custom Product to be created. You agree to provide only true, accurate, current and complete information in connection with any submission for a Custom Product, and further agree not to submit any type of file, virus, software, or other program that is capable of causing any damage, harm, interruption, or other failure to the Website, Brakar, or any other Users. If you do not provide all information requested, your submission will be discarded.

            You further understand and agree that submitting a request for a Custom Product does not guarantee that we will create the Custom Product for you, and we will first review your submission to determine, in our sole discretion, whether we can create the Custom Product. We may contact you at the email address you provide in your submission to understand your goals for the creation of the Custom Product as well as your budget. Based on this information, we will then provide you with a written estimate via email. In some cases, we may, in our sole discretion, agree to provide you with a mock-up of the Custom Product for your review. Once you provide us with written confirmation that you desire to purchase the Custom Product, unless we otherwise agree in writing, you must submit payment of a non-refundable deposit, equaling fifty (50%) percent of the estimate, through the Website before production of the Custom Product begins. 

            Depending on the complexity of the Custom Design, production can vary anywhere from two (2) weeks to multiple months. Once production has been completed, we will notify you via email, at which point you must then submit payment for the remaining fifty (50%) percent of the estimate. No Custom Products will be shipped to you unless and until we receive full payment of the estimate. 

            DISCLAIMER: ALTHOUGH WE DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATE FOR CUSTOM PRODUCTS IS ACCURATE, THERE MAY BE RARE INSTANCES WHERE WE MAY NEED TO ADJUST THE PRICE BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, AS DETERMINED IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION. IN THE EVENT THAT WE INCUR ANY EXTRA COSTS OR EXPENSES IN THE PRODUCTION PROCESS BEYOND THE AMOUNT OF THE ESTIMATE, THEN WE WILL NOTIFY YOU VIA EMAIL, AND THEREAFTER YOU SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYMENT OF THE REMAINING AMOUNT OF THE REVISED TOTAL COST BEFORE WE WILL SHIP THE CUSTOM PRODUCT TO YOU. IF YOU DO NOT PAY SUCH REVISED TOTAL COST IN FULL, THEN WE MAY ALLOW YOU TO CANCEL THE ORDER; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT THE INITIAL FIFTY (50%) PERCENT DEPOSIT IS NON-REFUNDABLE AND WILL NOT BE RETURNED TO YOU.

            For purposes of this Agreement, you and Brakar are each referred to as a “Party” and collectively, as the “Parties”. The Parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations for a period of at least thirty (30) days from initial written notice thereof, which shall be a requirement prior to either Party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms (including its formation, performance and breach), the Website, and any purchased Products, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the provisions of its Consumer Arbitration Rules, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to determine the validity of any claim and to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the Parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost.
            <p>You understand that, absent this mandatory provision, you would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. You further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</p>
